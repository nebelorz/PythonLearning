[X] = number of the course/courses

Inside each course, as some of the assignments required additional data than a .py file, there's a folder for the assignment

Also I want to point that many assignments has selfmade notes as comments inside the code, as I described almost everything that's weird for me at the moment, hope they're useful for you too :)
