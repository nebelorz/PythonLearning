[X] = number of the course/courses

Inside each course, if the assignment requieres additional data than a .py file, there's a folder for the assignment

Many assignments has selfmade notes as comments in the code, as I described almost everything that I didn't understood at the moment of coding, hope they're useful for you too :)
